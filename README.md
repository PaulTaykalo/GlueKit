# GlueKit
Yet another Swift framework for discrete reactive-style programming. There are many frameworks like it, but this one is mine! 

Similar frameworks are 
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa), 
[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), 
[ReactKit](https://github.com/ReactKit/ReactKit),
[Interstellar](https://github.com/JensRavens/Interstellar), and a million others.
